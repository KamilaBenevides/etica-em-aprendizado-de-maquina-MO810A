# Evasão e insucesso acadêmico
O conjunto de dados de evasão e insucesso acadêmico foi concebido com o objetivo de contribuir para a diminuição  do abandono e do insucesso acadêmico no ensino superior. Espera-se que, com dados do momento da matrícula do aluno - percurso acadêmico, dados demográficos e fatores socioeconômicos seja possível identificar alunos em risco em  uma fase inicial do seu percurso acadêmico, assim podendo ser implementadas estratégias de apoio aos mesmos.

## Reflections on Data
<!-- info: Use this space to include any additional information about the
dataset that has not been captured by the Data Card. For example,
does the dataset contain data that might be offensive, insulting, threatening,
or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please contact the appropriate parties
to mitigate any risks. -->

### Social Bias
Teachers or guidance counselors may inadvertently evaluate students' performance based on social stereotypes such as race, color, age and previous school history.
In addition, analysis of socio-economic data and parents' schooling can reveal social inequalities.

### Privacy
The database is made up of data from various sources, both internal and external to the educational institution, and as it was not collected directly from the students, there is no consent form from them. On the other hand, the database may contain information that a particular student doesn't want to disclose, such as their grade, parents' details and school debts.
