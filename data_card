# Evasão e insucesso acadêmico
O conjunto de dados de evasão e insucesso acadêmico foi concebido com o objetivo de contribuir para a diminuição  do abandono e do insucesso acadêmico no ensino superior. Espera-se que, com dados do momento da matrícula do aluno - percurso acadêmico, dados demográficos e fatores socioeconômicos seja possível identificar alunos em risco em  uma fase inicial do seu percurso acadêmico, assim podendo ser implementadas estratégias de apoio aos mesmos.
